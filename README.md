# Random HTML Pages

This repository is a collection of random HTML pages created purely for fun and experimentation.  
Each page serves as a small standalone project — from simple calculators to playful visual demos.

## Structure
- `index.html` — Landing page linking to all available tools and pages.
- Individual HTML files — Each file (e.g., `sports.html`) represents a unique mini project.

Feel free to explore, modify, or use these pages as inspiration for your own ideas.
